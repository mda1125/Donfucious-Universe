# Donfucious.com Code of Conduct

Welcome to the Loudest Movement in Fictional History.  
By participating in this project, you agree to the following terms of engagement:

---

## Core Principles

- **Loudness is respected.**
- **Victory is assumed.**
- **Wisdom is optional.**
- **Ego is encouraged (in moderation).**
- **Parody is protected.**
- **Real-world drama is not invited.**

---

## Expected Behavior

- Treat all contributors with exaggerated fake respect (and real respect too).
- Add ideas that make the Donfucious Universe funnier, sharper, and more absurd.
- Remember: This is satire. Keep it creative, not cruel.
- Stay fictional. No targeting of real-world individuals or political figures.

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Personal attacks, trolling, or genuine hostility
- Posting real-world political endorsements or hate speech
- Overcomplicating simple jokes (Donfucious would not approve)
- Forgetting to declare victory at regular intervals

---

## How We Resolve Issues

- Disagreements should be settled through:
  1. Louder jokes
  2. Better memes
  3. Occasional mock shouting contests (virtual)
- If conflict persists, a wise fictional council (you know, me) will declare the winner based on loudness and comedic value.

---

## Enforcement

- Violations will be handled by the fictional Department of Loudness & Satire Compliance.
- Sanctions may include:
  - Friendly reminders
  - Loud public shaming (fictional, of course)
  - Having your contributions turned into mock wisdom quotes

---

## Final Note

Remember:  
> “There are no mistakes in the Donfucious Universe. Only premature declarations of victory.” — Donfucious

By participating, you agree to make history louder, funnier, and completely fictional.
