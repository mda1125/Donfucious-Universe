# Adding a blog

Add a blog to this site that matches the CSS and current look of the site.  

The blog link should match the curent large buttons at the top of the site like the Gallery

The blog will link to a page that displays any posts in chronological order

You can find two blogs posts already in the _posts directory

From the blog there should be a button that matches the buttons on the current index that link back to the homepage

Adding a blog post will be manual and that's okay
