In a bold and unprecedented move, Donfucious today officially declared victory over gravity itself.

> “Gravity is optional. I simply choose to rise.” — Donfucious

At a packed press conference attended by at least three enthusiastic fictional supporters, Donfucious unveiled his "Loudness Over Physics" policy, claiming:

- Market crashes are not falls; they are strategic dives.
- Dropping objects is just leadership training for faster recovery.
- "What goes up must stay up — if you negotiate properly."

Donfucious promised future innovations including:
- Anti-gravity leadership seminars
- Gold-plated floating podiums
- Laws requiring all falling objects to submit loyalty pledges

Stay tuned for more declarations of victory over fundamental forces of nature.

History will thank him. Again.
